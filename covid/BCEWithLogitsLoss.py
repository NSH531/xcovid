class BCEWithLogitsLoss:
    r"""This loss combines a `Sigmoid` layer and the `BCELoss` in one single
    class. This version is more numerically stable than using a plain `Sigmoid`
    followed by a `BCELoss` as, by combining the operations into one layer,
    we take advantage of the log-sum-exp trick for numerical stability.

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_n \left[ y_n \cdot \log \sigma(x_n)
        + (1 - y_n) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_n)) \right],

    where :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), & \text{if reduction} = \text{'mean';}\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  & \text{if reduction} = \text{'sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    This is used for measuring the error of a reconstruction in for example
    an auto-encoder. Note that the targets `t[i]` should be numbers
    between 0 and 1.

    It's possible to trade off recall and precision by adding weights to positive examples.
    In the case of multi-label classification the loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell_c(x, y) = L_c = \{l_{1,c},\dots,l_{N,c}\}^\top, \quad
        l_{n,c} = - w_{n,c} \left[ p_c y_{n,c} \cdot \log \sigma(x_{n,c})
        + (1 - y_{n,c}) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_{n,c})) \right],

    where :math:`c` is the class number (:math:`c > 1` for multi-label binary classification,
    :math:`c = 1` for single-label binary classification),
    :math:`n` is the number of the sample in the batch and
    :math:`p_c` is the weight of the positive answer for the class :math:`c`.

    :math:`p_c > 1` increases the recall, :math:`p_c < 1` increases the precision.

    For example, if a dataset contains 100 positive and 300 negative examples of a single class,
    then `pos_weight` for the class should be equal to :math:`\frac{300}{100}=3`.
    The loss would act as if the dataset contains :math:`3\times 100=300` positive examples.

    Examples::

        >>> target = torch.ones([10, 64], dtype=torch.float32)  # 64 classes, batch size = 10
        >>> output = torch.full([10, 64], 1.5)  # A prediction (logit)
        >>> pos_weight = torch.ones([64])  # All weights are equal to 1
        >>> criterion = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=pos_weight)
        >>> criterion(output, target)  # -log(sigmoid(1.5))
        tensor(0.2014)

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to the loss
            of each batch element. If given, has to be a Tensor of size `nbatch`.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
        pos_weight (Tensor, optional): a weight of positive examples.
                Must be a vector with length equal to the number of classes.

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, *)` where :math:`*` means, any number of additional dimensions
        - Target: :math:`(N, *)`, same shape as the input
        - Output: scalar. If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then :math:`(N, *)`, same
          shape as input.

     Examples::

        >>> loss = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.empty(3).random_(2)
        >>> output = loss(input, target)
        >>> output.backward()
